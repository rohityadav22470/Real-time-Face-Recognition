## Overview
This project is a real-time face recognition application built using OpenCV, the face recognition library, and the Flask web framework. The application captures video from a webcam, detects faces in real-time, and recognizes known faces using a pre-trained model.

## Features
* Real-time face detection and recognition.
* Uses OpenCV for image processing and face detection.
* Utilizes the face recognition library for face matching.
* Built with Flask for a web-based interface.
* Supports adding and recognizing multiple known faces.
